# Welcome to Brisbane BitDevs

## About Brisbane BitDevs:
For everybody interested in the development of Bitcoin and the technical, economic and philosophical implications of it. You do not need to be a developer to listen in on, or even join the discussion about the technical workings of Bitcoin or of proposed changes or developments to it.

Submissions for topics are encouraged and can be submitted as a reply under the open issue. You can expect about a dozen or so topics per month. There will be a chairperson to facilitate the discussion and keep the evening flowing, but most topics will be introduced by the person who raised it. A short round-table discussion will follow each topic with an opportunity for comments and questions.

No topic is too technical or nuanced to be discussed, but most people will be able to relate to many topics on the agenda.

We do expect some topics to generate discussion. Opinionated, thoughtful and respectful reasoning is encouraged. Unfortunately, we do not have time to entertain topics related to other blockchains.
